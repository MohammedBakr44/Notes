Every Japanese sentences has two main *train carriages* A, B; Main Car and Engine respectively. We can say more about each car by adding other cars, but fundamentally: **All sentences** have both A and B cars.

The most basic types of sentences formed by A and B cars are 

<u>A is B</u> as in "Sakura is Japanese" 
and
<u>A does B</u> as in "Sakura walks"

If we take for example "Sakura walks"
The A car will be "Sakura"; and the B car will be 歩く.

To link the carriages we need a linchpin, and in Japanese it's the が particle.
## が particle

The が particle links A and B, it follows the A car since it's the subject of the sentence.

The sentence ”Sakura is Japanese" is 桜が日本人だ。

**だ** tells us that A is B, like an equal sign.

## Adjectives
Adjectives in Japanese ends with い

> ペンが赤いい。

no だ since the い at the end means **is-red**.

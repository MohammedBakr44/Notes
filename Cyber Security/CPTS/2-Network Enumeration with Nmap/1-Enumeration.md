Enumeration is the most critical part is it identifies all of the ways we could attack a target.

Tools are secondary, what matters the most is knowledge and attention to details.

>It is essential to understand how these services work and what syntax they use for effective communication and interaction with the different services.

> It's not hard to get access to the target system once we know how to do it. Most of the ways we can get access we can narrow down to the following two points:

- `Functions and/or resources that allow us to interact with the target and/or provide additional information.`

- `Information that provides us with even more important information to access our target.`

**Enumeration is the key**

>Most people understand that they haven't tried all the tools to get the information they need. Most of the time, however, it's not the tools we haven't tried, but rather the fact that we don't know how to interact with the service and what's relevant.

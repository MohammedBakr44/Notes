# Analysis:
> Is a deep study of a topic to formalise its behaviour.
## Real Analysis:
> Is the study of real numbers, sequences, series, functions of real numbers, it's also the foundation of *Calculus*.
- Calculus VS Analysis
	- Calculus focuses on computation(e.g what's the derivative of ${} x^2 {}$).
	- Analysis focuses on the behaviour  and the definition of a function(e.g what's differentiation and how can we generalise it? is the function differentiable or not? what does it mean for the function to be differentiable).

## Why
- What is a real number?
- What is the smallest positive real number?
- How come there are more rationals than real numbers?
- How do we take the limit of a sequence? and which have limits?
- Can you make all sequences converge(i.e their final result is a number not infinity)
- What is a function? what it does it mean for it to be differentiable or continuous?
- Is an infinite series differentiable?
- How and why rules we learned in Calculus works?
## Roadmap
- Just read through the book

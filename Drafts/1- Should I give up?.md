**TL;DR Yes**

Honestly idk what's this, could be a journal or something, it will be `.gitignore`'d and sent to some chosen people, maybe someone will leak it after I commit  suicide and [Amr Adeeb](https://www.wikiwand.com/ar/%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%88_%D8%A3%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A8) will comment that I was creative, skilful individual who shouldn't have done that while laughing like [Terry Henry](https://i.imgflip.com/4f0cgl.jpg) meme as the population decreased by 1.  

Anyways, I should start answering my question, should I -or you the reader- give up? probably yes, but first if you have one of these you shouldn't give up

- Born in a rich family, you don't need to work or you have to do minimal work to get your living.
- You're already a successful person and showed early signs of being a success in the future.
- You have someone who cares about you other than local coffee shop waiter.

Now I can answer the question, being born in a 3rd world country especially living in a ghetto-like environment where you can't even buy Discord Nitro because you're locked out from international transactions; is a reason to give up as every task you can think of is almost impossible to perform or requires a lot of shenanigans. 

Being a failure, I started my life as a failure, as my education system is retard I only have one and only chance to become a decent human being which is the final year of high school, despite being an A student in all of my previous years, I failed in the only year that will determine my rank in society and currently I'm studying in a place full of old drawing of a jew look-alikes retards with two brain cells used to innovate new scamming techniques.

Of course being a failure continued with getting shitty grades despite studying; I invented a mental illness disorder for this case-I know no one asked, I didn't ask you too- it's called `Clinical Skill Issue`.

### Clinical Skill Issue
**Symptoms**
- Concentration problems, no matter how important is the task for you or how much you enjoy its pop-science videos.
- Failing despite how many times you try.
- Everyone in your age achieved more.

**Treatment**
- kys.



### Learning Japanese
One of the reasons I invented `Clinical Skill Issue` is my Japanese journey, in my way to be 日本語上手 I tried three times in different years, 2020, 2022, 2024, at the three times I found someone who has started soon or wants to start and to my surprise all of them became ペラペラ while I'm here stuck in 単語 N4 can't even pass moe easiest quiz.

No matter how I try mining, reading エロゲー, novels, watching anime it all goes in vain.


Some people might say I'm acting as a victim, but it's actually not, I'm not blaming anything it's just me; too retard to do anythin. Some people called it `ADHD` since I can barely read two lines of text without checking my phone looking for the hidden notification that says *I won 1m Colombian Peso*, a scam doctor(therapist) said it's depression that's making me nonfunctional, gave me some weak ass meth so the educated drug dealer can make some money.
 It made me functional for a couple of months but the skill issue is eternal you can't treat that.

Anyways, that's enough, I'm 3.2k characters already, from the aforementioned facts, and me being a perfect example for a `Condoms` ad campaign, I should give up, I don't know how: should I jump off `Cairo Tower`? maybe cut all the connections and disappear, no one cares anyway even if they claimed the opposite. I don't know. If you read this you will know in the future if I gave up or I kept living maybe getting somewhere in this shitty simulation where only 1% make it.

# Malware
>Any software that does something that causes detriment to the user, computer, or networkâ€”such as viruses, trojan horses, worms, rootkits, scareware, and spyware

# Purpose
> Providing information about how malware works or what's needed to respond to malware's effect such as network intrusion.

# Identifying Malware
## Host-based signatures
> Focuses on malware behaviour such as files create or registeries edited.

## Network-based signatures
> Uses network traffic to detect malware.

# Analysis techniques
## Basic Static Analysis
> Examining the PE(portable executable) without viewing its instruction(e.g disassembly). Though it can confirm if the file malicious or not, it doesn't work with sophisticated malware.

## Basic Dynamic Analysis
> Running the malware in order to monitor its bahaviour so you can remove it or produce signatures.

## Advanced Static Analysis
> Reverse-Engineering source file to look at its instruction in order to understand how it works exactly.

## Advanced Dynamic Analysis
> Using a debugger to investigate malware's behaviour. Used to gather information that can't be found in Static Analysis

# Types of Malware
## Backdoor
> Malicious software that installs itself onto a computer allowing the attacker access; usually letting the attacker to execute commands without authentication.

## Botnet
> Similar to backdoor, though all infected systems can receive a single command from a command-and-control server; *allowing them to act as an army(usually called zombies) used for attacks like [DDoS Attacks]((https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/))*

## Downloader
> A program that downloads and installs another malicious program/s-*usually called the payload*- after gaining access to the system.

## Information-stealing malware
> Collects information from victim's computer(e.g sniffers, password hash grabbers, and keyloggers); usually used to gain access to online accounts. *Some modern information-stealers target cookies in order to gain access to online accounts without logging on, this happened to many YouTubers like [LinusTechTips](https://youtu.be/nYdS3FIu3rI).*

## Launcher
> Malicious code that launches another malicious code, usually to ensure stealth and evasion or greater access to the system.

## Rootkit
>Used to cover the existence of other [malicious] code, usually paired with a backdoor to allow remote access.

## Scareware
> Malware designed to scare the victim, usually has a UI that looks like an Antivirus in order to convince the victim to buy it; to get rid of malicious software while it only removes the scareware itself.

## Spam-sending malware
> Uses victim's machine to send spam, attackers gain profit from selling spam-sending service. *These are very common nowadays on Discord, NTTS has a [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEqYobHF0_Nk50vPzBKZFdcYHMzEyhuU3) that covers many Spam-sending scams;  though most of them depends on phishing some scams used malware.* 

## Worm/Virus
> Malware that copies itself, *usually affecting other machines on the same network.*

# Mass vs Targeted malware
- Mass malware, such as Scareware, affects as many machines as possible(shotgun approach).
	- See [wannacry](https://youtu.be/PKHH_gvJ_hA)
- Targeted malware, like a one-of-a-kind backdoor used to target specific victim, it makes a bigger threat. *This term can include malware that utilises [Zero Day attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/zero-day-exploit/) such as Stuxnet.*

# General Rules for Malware Analysis
- Don't get too caught up in the details; focus on key features.
- different tools and approaches are available for different jobs.

> [R]emember that malware analysis is like a cat-and-mouse game. As
> new malware analysis techniques are developed, malware authors respond
> with new techniques to thwart analysis. To succeed as a malware analyst, you
> must be able to recognize, understand, and defeat these techniques, and
> respond to changes in the art of malware analysis.

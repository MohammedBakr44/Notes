# Chapter 14: Malware-Focused Network Signatures

This chapter focuses on developing effective network-based countermeasures by understanding how malware uses the network and leveraging the challenges faced by malware authors.

## 1. Network Countermeasures

- **New Concepts with Definitions:**
    
    - **Countermeasures:** Actions taken in response to threats to **detect or prevent malicious activity**.
    - **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** An older term for systems that use **signatures to detect malicious network activity**, such as scanning, service enumeration, nonstandard protocol use, and beaconing from installed malware.
    - **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** Similar to an IDS, but also **designed to prevent malicious traffic** from traveling over the network.
    - **Domain Registrar:** A registry that stores **registration information for a domain name**, including the domain, its name servers, relevant dates, and contact information.
    - **Regional Internet Registries (RIRs):** Registries that store **IP address blocks**, their organizational assignments, and various contact information.
    - **Blacklists:** Metadata that can apply to **IP addresses or domain names**, used to identify known malicious entities.
    - **Geographical Information:** Metadata that applies **only to IP addresses**.
    - **OPSEC (Operations Security):** A concept highlighting the importance of **protecting an attacker's operational details**; analysis activities, especially network-focused ones, can inadvertently reveal information to the attacker.
- **New Tools:**
    
    - **Command-line tools (e.g., whois, dig):** Used for **manually querying** domain and IP registries.
    - **Free websites for lookups (e.g., DomainTools):** Provide **automated lookups, follow-on lookups, anonymity, and additional metadata** for domain and IP information.
        - **DomainTools (www.domaintools.com):** A specific website providing historical whois records, reverse IP lookups, and reverse whois lookups.
- **Practical Application for Introduced Info in Analysis:**
    
    - The initial step in network-focused malware analysis should be to **review existing data** (logs, alerts, packet captures) already generated by the malware, rather than immediately running or disassembling it.
    - **Passively reviewing information** carries no risk of analysis activities being leaked to the attacker.
    - Identifying indicators like **suspicious DNS requests, HTTP GET requests, or direct IP beaconing** can provide initial defense points.
    - Domain and IP address information from registries can be valuable for defending against specific malware versions.
    - Using lookup websites offers benefits such as automated follow-on lookups, anonymity, and access to additional metadata.

## 2. Content-Based Network Countermeasures

- **New Concepts with Definitions:**
    
    - **Signature-based IDSs:** Systems that detect malicious activity by relying on **predefined knowledge of what malicious activity looks like** to create signatures.
    - **True Positive:** An alert generated **correctly indicating malicious activity**.
    - **False Positive:** An alert generated for traffic that **appears malicious but is legitimate**.
    - **Snort:** The **most popular open-source Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**.
    - **Snort Rule:** Consists of a header defining conditions and rule options providing additional details.
        - **`content` keyword:** Searches for **specific byte sequences or patterns** within the packet payload; the pipe symbol `|` indicates hexadecimal notation.
        - **`msg` keyword:** Specifies the **message to be printed** with an alert or log entry.
        - **`classtype` keyword:** Defines the **general category** to which a rule belongs.
        - **`sid` keyword:** A **unique identifier** for rules.
        - **`rev` keyword:** Uniquely identifies rule **revisions** when combined with `sid`.
        - **`flow` keyword:** Specifies **characteristics of the TCP flow** being inspected, such as whether a flow has been established or if packets are from the client/server.
        - **`isdataat` keyword:** Verifies that **data exists at a given location** (optionally relative to the last match).
        - **`distance` keyword:** Modifies the `content` keyword, indicating the **number of bytes to ignore** past the most recent pattern match.
        - **`pcre` keyword:** Uses **Perl Compatible Regular Expressions** to indicate the pattern of bytes to match.
- **New Tools:**
    
    - **Snort:** An open source Network Intrusion Detection System used for **writing and testing network-based signatures**.
- **Practical Application for Introduced Info in Analysis:**
    
    - **Content-based indicators are more valuable and longer-lasting** than basic IP/domain indicators because they identify malware using more fundamental characteristics.
    - The goal is to create **ideal signatures that generate true positives without false positives**.
    - Analysts can use **Snort to create robust signatures** for malicious network activity.
    - Understanding specific Snort keywords is crucial for **detailed and effective signature creation**.
    - Relying solely on basic network indicators can provide a **false sense of security**; deeper analysis is necessary for truly robust countermeasures.

## 3. Combining Dynamic and Static Analysis Techniques

- **New Concepts with Definitions:**
    
    - **Full Coverage of Functionality:** The process of **increasing the amount of code executed and observed** during dynamic analysis, often by providing varied inputs or forcing different code paths.
    - **Operational Replication:** The ability to **create a tool that precisely mimics the attacker's remote operation capabilities** for the malware (e.g., a server that can trigger every function of a client-side malware).
    - **Surface Analysis:** An **initial assessment of indicators**, typically equivalent to the output provided by automated sandboxes.
    - **Communication Method Coverage:** Understanding the **specific code implementations for each type of communication technique** used by malware.
    - **Hard-Coded Data:** Malware data that is **directly embedded in the binary** and remains constant, making it highly valuable for creating stable network signatures.
    - **Ephemeral Data:** Malware data that **changes frequently** (e.g., system hostnames, time-based values, random numbers), which is less suitable for stable signatures as it varies between infections.
- **New Tools:**
    
    - No specific new tools are introduced in this section; the emphasis is on **integrating existing dynamic and static analysis tools** and techniques.
- **Practical Application for Introduced Info in Analysis:**
    
    - **Deeper analysis beyond initial dynamic output** is essential for developing more accurate and lasting network signatures.
    - The objectives of deeper analysis include achieving **full coverage of functionality** and, ideally, **operational replication**.
    - Analysts should determine the **appropriate level of analysis** required for effective indicators to avoid overanalysis.
    - Effective signatures must **differentiate malware traffic from normal traffic**, a challenge compounded by malware authors' efforts to blend in.
    - Understanding the **origin of network content** (hard-coded, ephemeral, configuration data, algorithms) is crucial for effective signature creation.
    - **Prioritize hard-coded data** for signature generation due to its stability.
    - When dealing with encoded data, it's vital to **identify and leverage the encoding steps** to reveal stable, underlying content.
    - Signatures can directly **target specific hard-coded elements or patterns** derived from the analyzed code.
    - Analyzing **parsing routines for incoming traffic** can also yield elements for signature generation, as custom parsing functions often have distinct, recognizable patterns.
    - **Targeting multiple distinct elements with separate signatures** enhances resilience against attacker modifications.
    - Analysts should leverage **attacker weaknesses**, such as their preference for simple implementations, consistent unique identifiers, and attempts to blend with legitimate traffic.

## 4. Understanding the Attackerâ€™s Perspective

- **New Concepts with Definitions:**
    
    - No new formal concepts are defined; this section reinforces the idea that **understanding attacker strategies** (like hiding activity and thwarting analysis) is key to effective defense.
- **New Tools:**
    
    - No new tools are introduced.
- **Practical Application for Introduced Info in Analysis:**
    
    - Malware analysis significantly **improves the effectiveness of network defense** by providing critical insights into the signature-generation process.
    - Signatures derived from malware analysis are generally **more precise**, reduce the need for trial and error, and are **more likely to identify new strains** of the same malware family.
    - Analysts must be prepared for and capable of countering **active measures taken by malware authors to prevent effective analysis** (anti-reverse-engineering techniques).

## 5. Conclusion

### Chapter 14: Malware-Focused Network Signatures

Herein, we delve into the core of Chapter 14, focusing on how malware utilizes network connectivity and how we, as analysts, can develop robust countermeasures.

#### Network Countermeasures

- **New Concepts:**
    - **Countermeasures:** These are the actions we take, designed to detect or prevent malicious activity in response to identified threats.
    - **OPSEC (Operations Security):** This concept reminds us to be mindful of how our investigative actions might reveal our presence to attackers, especially when we're passively observing data.
    - **Network Indicators:** These are the tell-tale signs of malicious activity observable on the network, such as domain names, specific IP addresses, or the particular content of an HTTP request.
- **New Tools:** No specific new tools are explicitly introduced in this initial part.
- **Practical Application in Analysis:** Understanding how malware interacts with the network is paramount for crafting effective network-based defenses. By passively observing information, we can gather intelligence without alerting the adversary. Identifying key network indicatorsâ€”like a specific DNS request or an unusual HTTP GETâ€”forms the foundation for our defensive strategies.
- **Examples:** Consider a scenario where malware requests a DNS resolution for `www.badsite.com`, then performs an HTTP GET, and later attempts to beacon to an IP address without a DNS query. Each of these actions provides a distinct network indicator for analysis.

When should you revisit this section? Return here when you need to confirm the foundational definitions of network countermeasures and indicators.

#### Safely Investigate an Attacker Online

- **New Concepts:**
    - **Indirection Tactics:** These are the methods attackers employ to obscure their true identity or location, often by routing through compromised systems.
    - **Domain Registrar:** This is the entity responsible for registering domain names, holding crucial details like the domain itself, its name servers, registration dates, and contact information.
    - **Regional Internet Registries (RIRs):** These are organizations that manage and store information about IP address blocks, including their organizational assignments and various contact details.
    - **Blacklists:** These are lists, applicable to both IP addresses and domain names, that identify known malicious entities.
- **New Tools:**
    - **DomainTools:** This is a valuable resource (`http://www.domaintools.com/`) for obtaining historical `whois` records, performing reverse IP lookups to find all domains resolving to a specific IP, and conducting reverse `whois` searches based on contact information.
- **Practical Application in Analysis:** Gathering comprehensive IP address and domain information is vital for mapping an attacker's infrastructure. Utilizing `whois` services and checking blacklists can reveal crucial insights into threat actors.
- **Examples:** An examination of two separate `whois` requests for different command-and-control domains revealed that they shared the same registration name, suggesting a common attacker behind distinct backdoors.

When should you revisit this section? Refer back here when you're preparing to pivot from network indicators to attacker infrastructure intelligence.

#### Content-Based Network Countermeasures

- **New Concepts:**
    - **Signature-based IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems):** These systems are designed to identify malicious network activity by matching traffic patterns against known signatures.
    - **True Positive:** This occurs when an IDS correctly flags actual malicious activity.
    - **False Positive:** This is when an IDS incorrectly flags legitimate activity as malicious.
    - **Snort:** A widely-used open-source network intrusion detection system, instrumental for crafting network-based signatures.
    - **Snort Rules:** These are customizable directives used by Snort to define and detect specific patterns of malicious network behavior.
    - **PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions):** A powerful notation for defining complex pattern matches within Snort rules.
- **New Tools:**
    - **Snort:** While mentioned before, its role here as the primary tool for developing content-based signatures is emphasized.
- **Practical Application in Analysis:** Content-based indicators are generally more enduring and effective than simple IP or domain blocks because they focus on the fundamental characteristics of the malware's communication. Crafting effective Snort rules involves using various keywords to specify conditions, such as `content` for payload inspection, `msg` for alerts, `classtype` for categorization, and `sid` and `rev` for unique identification.
- **Examples:**
    - A practical Snort rule demonstrates how to match a specific HTTP header, like `User-Agent: Wefa7e`, by converting parts of the string into hexadecimal notation using pipe symbols (`|`).
    - Another example shows a Snort rule that leverages PCRE to detect a `User-Agent` string where "We" is followed by exactly four alphanumeric characters, showcasing the flexibility of regular expressions in signature creation.

#### Combining Dynamic and Static Analysis Techniques

- **New Concepts:**
    - **Full Coverage of Functionality:** This objective involves meticulously extending dynamic analysis to ensure as much of the malware's code as possible is executed and observed, revealing more complete behavior.
    - **Operational Replication:** This signifies the advanced capability to develop a tool, such as a custom server-side controller, that can fully interact with and command the malware.
    - **Malware Analysis Levels:** A tiered approach to analysis, progressing from basic "Surface analysis" (like sandbox output) to "Communication method coverage" (understanding network code) and finally to "Operational replication".
    - **Hard-Coded Data:** Immutably embedded information within the malware binary itself, which is exceptionally valuable for generating stable and reliable network signatures.
- **New Tools:** No specific new tools are introduced in this section, as the focus is on analytical methodologies.
- **Practical Application in Analysis:** By seamlessly blending dynamic execution observation with static code disassembly, we can unearth deeper characteristics of the malware. This depth leads to more precise and resilient network signatures. Understanding the various analysis levels helps us determine when we have gathered sufficient intelligence for effective countermeasures. Prioritizing the identification of hard-coded data within the malware's communication patterns yields the strongest and most lasting signatures.
- **Examples:**
    - Malware that retrieves commands from a seemingly innocuous web page, embedding instructions within HTML comment fields (e.g., `adsrv?` followed by Base64-encoded commands), illustrates a common evasion tactic.
    - An IDA Pro graph of a custom parsing routine demonstrates how malware might process such hidden commands from web content, highlighting its internal logic.
    - Specific malware commands like `longsleep` or `run:www.example.com/fast.exe` are shown alongside their Base64-encoded forms, providing concrete examples of command structures.
    - The chapter details how elements like fixed network protocol separators, system uptime, and username, when derived predictably, can be combined into a robust regular expression for signature creation, even when parts are encoded.

When should you revisit this section? This is your go-to guide when you need to deepen your malware analysis beyond initial observations to craft superior network signatures.

We started checking strings to see if it could lead to something, it uses a minimal amount of functions but that doesn't confirm if it's packed or not. Though, it have some interesting strings, there seems to be a stacked URL, we can use it that later as we know it's a downloader from virus total.

Moving on, we launch `pestudio` to check the sections in PE header, we can see that the sections are named differently, UPX* to be precise, also the section UPX0 has 0 bytes `raw size` and 0x4000 `virtual size`; these leads to the conclusion that the file is packed using UPX

Final check using PEiD confirms that it's packed with UPX

In order to unpack it we use UPX utility with the command `upx -d {file}`

We now can start checking for the real data of the sample.

Looking at the imported functions, we can assume that the file doesn't start immediately, rather, it stays inactive until a certain condition happens, probably after some time passes; we can conclude that from `CreateWaitableTimerA`, `SetWaitableTimer`, `SystemTimeToFileTime`, and `WaitForSingleObject` functions. We can also see that there are two functions for opening a URL using `InternetOpenA`, and `InternetOpenUrlA` functions. We can safely assume it's a downloader that's waits for some time or some condition to happen and then starts downloading the real malware.

Let's dig into the strings and see if we can find something interesting. first we revisit strings before unpacking, we can see this stack of strings

after combining it into one like we get `https://wwareanysisbook.co/` it leads to nothing so it's most probably obfuscated. Let's take a look at the strings after unpacking

We can see this URL `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com`; which is most probably the URL the sample passes to the function `InternetOpenUrl`.

We can check if any files downloaded after infection, any outgoing requests since we are certain it visits some URL.

Looking for any signs of packing, starting with the sections, everything seems normal

Looking at the strings we can see there are 84 strings with many functions, and some interesting strings; which is an indication that the file is not packed.

We finally confirm with PEiD and we can now confirm it's unpacked.

Looking at the imports we can see some interesting, yet suspicious functions
![](https://imgur.com/JoIjrK5.jpg)

We can supposedly trace some of this file steps using some of these functions, `OpenProcess` to access a local process, `GetCurrentProcess` gets current process handle, the more suspicious functions are the ones from `advapi32.dll` which are-in this file- `OpenProcessToken`, `LookupPrivilegeValueA`,  and `AdjustTokenPrivileges` these functions combined try to access the `token` of some process lookup for its `privileges` and try to `adjust` them, probably doing some kind of `privilege esclation`, at the end it creates a new thread using `CreateRemoteThread`.
Finally, it creates a file `CreateFileA`, write something to it `WriteFile` and moves it to some path `MoveFile`; probably executing it using `WinExec`.

Checking program's strings we can find some clues

We can clearly spot a link to another exe `http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/updater.exe`  which we can use a network-based indicator.

As for host-based indicators; file's strings contained paths to  `\winup.exe`, `\system32\wupdmgrd.exe`, `winlogon`.
with `wupdmgrd`, and `winlogon` being Windows system files, while `winup`* was reported by many resources to be a malicious file that's not part of Windows core apps.

* [winup](https://www.file.net/process/winup.exe.html), [Microsoft forums](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/winupexe/e040cc90-3535-4b66-aeb7-3b6537d53982)

Using `Resource Hacker` we can see the file has only one resource, a PE.

We extract the file and do the preliminary procedures, the file shows no signs of being packed or obfuscated

We can now start looking at the imports to try to guess its effect.

There's not much happening here, it basically downloads a file from a URL `URLDownloadToFileA` and executes it using `WinExec` which makes it a downloader malware. We can use the URL-`http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/updater.exe`- we discovered before to find the file it's trying to download, the URL is not working anymore so there's nothing else we can do.

First we check the exe file, we can see from PEStudio that it's looking for a file, creating a file and copying another. There's also a string comparison happening(`_stricmp`) Probably creating a file if a specific file is found reads data from a specific file and applies a condition if it had some content? more advanced analysis techniques needed to confirm this.

> `UnmapViewOfFile`, `MapViewOfFile`, `CreateFileMappingA`, `CreateFileA`,`FindNextFileA`, `FindFirstFileA`, `CopyFileA`.

The `.dll` file shows some interesting functions, it looks like it initiates a process with a single thread(`mutex`), it also starts internet connection. Nothing is confirmed here all we can give is wild guesses, it could be sending data to the attacker or some sort of kill switch(as PEStudio noted `sandbox evasion`), as the case with `.exe` file; more advanced analysis techniques needed to confirm.

These files creates a process, look for some file, reads a file and copies it,  this could be a `ransomware` that encrypts the files. Also it shows some network-based interactions which could be a sandbox evasion or uploading files to a remote server.

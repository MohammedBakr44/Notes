# Question
1- `0x1000D02E`

2- `0x100163CC`

3- 18

4- as there's `push eax` before function call, this indicates `eax` being an argument for `gethostbyname` function, which means the `DNS` is stored in it. So the `DNS` is `pics.praticalmalwareanalysis.com`.

5, 6 - As local variables are prefixed with `var_` and arguments are prefixed with `arg_` we can see that the function has **12** local variables and **0** arguments.

7- `0x10095B34`

8- It does some kind of comparison, and jumps to `0x10010D7` that pushes `\\command.exe /c` to memory, which runes `command.exe`, if the condition is not met, it will push `\\cmd.exe /c` running cmd and then do an `unconditional jump` to `0x10010D7` running `\\command.exe /c`.

9- Set by `eax` value in address `0x10001687` in subroutine `sub_10001656`

10- if `memcmp` returned zero, then `0x1001045C` which has `jnz` is going to be ignored and a subroutine at `0x100052A2` will be called

11- it calls a subroutine at `0x100036C3` which looks like getting some information about the system, then it checks if `eax` is zero, if so it jumps to `0x1000705B` which ends the function. Otherwise, it calls strlen, after that it checks if `eax` is zero, if not then it jumps to `0x1000704E` calls `sub_1000664C` with parameters `[esp+Str]` and 0.
In case `eax` is zero then it runs `sub_10006518` with `eax` as a parameter, this subroutine starts some kind of process using `OpenProcess` function.
After all of that the function starts its `epologue` at `0x1000705A`.

12- `GetSystemDefaultID`, `sprintf`, `strlen`. The function can be renamed to `getSystemLanguage`, or `getUserLangauge`.

I decided to go with `getSystemLanguage`

13-

14- `1000ms` = 1s

15- `protocol`, `type`, `af`.

16- `af` can be changed to `addressFamily` as `af` is not clear what it's purpose.

17- The instruction `0xED` was only found once, looking at the function the value `564D5868` is used in eax, and then `dx` is copied from `I/O` port into `eax` register.

After converting these values to strings, we can see they are `VMHx`.

This concludes there's VMWare detection being done in the code.

18- Stack string, looks like some encrypted text, could be an encryption routine, no evidence to support that though.

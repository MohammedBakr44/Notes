## Suspicious activity 
We can see from monitoring registry changes some suspicious registry keys being created

Looking at Procdot graph, we can see indeed that the sample does edit these registry keys, also it writes itself to harddisk; so it can autostart

## Network signatures
Using `Fakenet` and `Wireshark` we can see that the malware is trying to connect to `serv1.ec2-102-95-13-2.ubuntu.local` in order to download `msdcorelib.exe`.

In order to get the full behaviour, the file in fakenetDefaults was renamed to `msdcorelib.exe` to check if the sample do run this file. After a reboot we can see our file being executed

## Host-based signatures

Using `RegistryChangesView` we can see that the sample modified and added values for these reigsters.

We can use these registers as host-based signatures to confirm if the machine is infected.

After following network activity, we can check startup programs 
`C:\\Users\{username}\AppDate\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\`
to check if there's a file called `mscoredll.exe`, this file is created by malware in order to run the malware on `startup`.
